NLP Project Hate speech detection

Introduction
This project focuses on building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze and classify textual data from Twitter. The primary objective is to detect and categorize tweets into one of three classes: hate speech, offensive language, or no hate speech. Leveraging libraries such as NLTK and Pandas, the project preprocesses the data, performs exploratory data analysis, and applies machine learning techniques to achieve accurate classification. This work aims to contribute to the detection of harmful online content and promote safer digital environments.

Overview
Data Handling: The project reads and processes Twitter data from a CSV file (twitter_data.csv).
Libraries Used:
NLTK: A library for natural language processing, suggesting tasks like tokenization, stemming, or text analysis.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Regular Expressions (re): Indicates some form of text cleaning or pattern matching.
Target Labels:
Hate Speech Detection: The data includes a labeled classification system (hate_speech, offensive_language, no_hate_speech).
Initial Steps:
Data exploration includes loading the dataset, inspecting its structure (head, info), and analyzing label distribution.

This project successfully implements a Natural Language Processing pipeline for detecting and categorizing tweets into predefined classes: hate speech, offensive language, and no hate speech. By utilizing powerful libraries like NLTK and Pandas, the workflow efficiently handles data preprocessing, exploration, and analysis. The classification model developed through this project demonstrates the potential of NLP techniques to identify harmful content in social media, providing a valuable tool for moderation and community safety. Future enhancements could include integrating deep learning methods and expanding the dataset for improved performance and scalability.
